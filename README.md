## Features

- **Real-time Typing Feedback**: Highlights correct and incorrect letters while typing, giving instant feedback on mistakes.
- **WPM Calculation**: Calculates Words Per Minute (WPM) based on typing accuracy and speed, updating in real-time during the session.
- **Error Tracking**: Keeps track of mistakes and provides a visual indication to help identify areas for improvement.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a better user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
